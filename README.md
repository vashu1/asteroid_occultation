# asteroid_occultation

## Software and versions
- python
- Java 7

## Implementation
### Simulation
Simulation is implemented as python script.

### Solution
Solution is a Java program.

## How to launch
Compile Java code and execute:

```java solution.SmartSolutionManager NUMBER_OF_ITERATIONS```

NUMBER_OF_ITERATIONS is an optional parameter indicating the number of times the algorithm will be executed.

That will run simulation and solution. A new set of data input files is generated on every iteration.

The output of the program is result.txt file containing the list of errors for each iteration and also the number of iterations with no solutions.


## Sample data
See sample input and output data within the doc folder.
